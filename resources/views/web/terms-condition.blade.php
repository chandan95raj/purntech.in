                <p>PurnTech is not an expert in your intellectual property rights, and we cannot verify that the
                    users of our online marketplace – who post literally tens of thousands of trade leads for items
                    on the website each day – have the right to sell the goods offered. We will appreciate your
                    assistance in identifying listings which may not appear on their face to infringe your rights
                    but which you believe are infringing. PurnTech is also not an arbiter or judge of disputes
                    about intellectual property rights. By taking down a listing, as a prudential matter, PurnTech is not endorsing a claim of infringement. Neither, in those instances in which PurnTech
                    declines to take down a listing, is PurnTech determining that the listing is not infringing,
                    nor is PurnTech endorsing the sale of goods in such cases. PurnTech respects the
                    intellectual property rights of others, and we expect our user(s) to do the same. We believes
                    that user(s) agree that they will not copy, download &amp; reproduce any information, text,
                    images, video clips, directories, files, databases or listings available on or through the web
                    site (the “www.purntech.in ) for the purpose of online transaction, re-selling or
                    re-distributing, mass mailing (via email, wireless text messages, physical mail or otherwise),
                    operating a business competing with PurnTech , or otherwise commercially exploiting the PurnTech content. Systematic retrieval of PurnTech content to create or compile, directly or
                    indirectly, a collection, compilation, database or directory (whether through robots, spiders,
                    automatic devices or manual processes) without written permission from PurnTech is
                    prohibited. In addition, use of the content for any purpose not expressly permitted in this Term
                    of use is prohibited and may invite legal action. As a condition of your access to and use of
                    PurnTech ’s services, you agree that you will not use the web site service to infringe the
                    intellectual property rights of others in any way. PurnTech reserves the right to terminate
                    the account of a user(s) upon any infringement of the rights of others in conjunction with use
                    of the PurnTech service, or if PurnTech believes that user(s) conduct is harmful to the
                    interests of PurnTech , its affiliates, or other users, or for any other reason in PurnTech’s sole discretion, with or without cause.</p>
